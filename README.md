# Todo List for Travelers

Simple Todo List I built from scratch for collaboratively listing things to bring with us for a travel with my girlfriend.

The listing element is an editable HTML, and you can remove elements by clicking on the ðŸ’” icon.

The "Download your List" functionality generates a client-side txt.

The dummy backend only saves the frontend computed HTML. Is kept in sync via pooling.

The initial project has rapid development in mind, not security.

## Future roadmap for this project

- [ ] Login functionality
- [ ] Multiple todolists
- [ ] Server-side cleanup of the HTML tags for XSS prevention
- [ ] Dockerization
